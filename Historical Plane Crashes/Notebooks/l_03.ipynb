In an attempt to force land before running out of fuel, they probably had an engine failure from fuel starvation in the lower engine as they oozed around in a slow turn where the captain would have been peering forward out of an open window, trying to locate a lighter (more grassy) spot in the bush to put down in rain. They probably would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top.

The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots. The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It's unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed.</td><td>Weather</td><td>Air France</td></tr><tr><td>A helicopter bound for offshore oil fields went down about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans shortly after taking off. The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions.</td><td>Other</td><td>Petroleum Helicopters Inc</td></tr><tr><td>Crashed while attempting to land. The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.</td><td>Weather</td><td>Empire Airlines leased from FedEx</td></tr><tr><td>The air ambulance crashed shortly after departure after dropping off a patient and while returning to base. The pilot, medic and nurse were all killed. The pilot’s decision to continue the visual flight rules flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in the pilot’s spatial disorientation and a loss of control of the helicopter. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate oversight of the flight by Omniflight’s Operational Control Center.</td><td>Pilot Error</td><td>Omniflight Helicopters Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>The commuter plane crashed while attemptiong to land in rain and sleet, 6 miles northeast of Buffalo Niagara International Airport, were it was scheduled to land. Preliminary evidence suggests the crew selected the landing gear down and set the flaps 15 degrees. Immediately after selecting the flaps the stick shaker activated. The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft's instruments and failed to follow the airline's procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.</td><td>Weather</td><td>Continental Connection/Colgan Air</td></tr><tr><td>Contact was lost with the aircraft 15 minutes after taking off. Debris was found in the Bintang mountains at an elevation of 9,300 feet. The crew did not maintain visual flight procedures when flying below lowest safe altitude, and the aircraft was flown into cloud in the vicinity of gap north west of Oksibil. The accident was consistent with controlled flight into terrain.</td><td>Pilot Error</td><td>Merpati Nusantara Airlines</td></tr><tr><td>The cargo plane crashed mid-flight after entering an area of thunderstorms.</td><td>Weather</td><td>Juba Air Cargo</td></tr><tr><td>The charter aircraft crashed into a steep hillside on south Thormanby Island 19 minutes after taking off and exploded into flames.

The engine appears to have failed. Loss of engine power during approach for landing due to a fatigue fracture of a power turbine blade.</td><td>Weather</td><td>Island Express Helicopter Service</td></tr><tr><td>After taking off, the aircraft climbed to 12,500 feet. While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall.</td><td>Weather</td><td>East African Air Charters</td></tr><tr><td>The cargo plane was carrying mail when it crashed into the sea, 7 miles south of Lihu. The pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness. Contributing to the accident were the dark night and the task requirements of simultaneously monitoring the cockpit instruments and the other airplane.</td><td>Pilot Error</td><td>Apline Aviation</td></tr><tr><td>While landing in heavy rain and strong cross winds, the aircraft skidded off the runway, struck an earth embankment and caught fire. The pilot attempted to land, despite 15 warning alarms and his copilot's calls to abort the attempt. Also, the plane was traveling faster and descending more sharply than normal.</td><td>Weather</td><td>One-Two-Go Airlines</td></tr><tr><td>The cargo plane, carrying tin ore, lost one of it's two engines eleven minutes after taking off and tried to return to the airport. Due to strong back winds and a fully loaded plane, the aircraft clipped tree tops and crashed and burned 3 km short of the runway. The plane was overloaded by 3 tons.</td><td>Other</td><td>Great Lakes Business Complany</td></tr><tr><td>While making an approach to land, the passenger plane struck a mountaintop and broke apart, 7.5 miles from Isparta Airport. The accident was caused by pilot error as a result of the condition known as spatial disorientation. The pilot is believed to have lost the sight of line for the horizon and instead of trusting the flight instruments, diverted the aircraft to the route where the crash occurred.</td><td>Pilot Error</td><td>Atlasjet Airlines</td></tr><tr><td>The pilot attempted to land using full flaps and touched down about halfway down the runway. He aborted the landing and applied power to take off. The aircraft struck trees beyond the end of the runway. The airport  is served by a 2,300 foot runway with a significant downslope on one end. The runway had been exposed to recent heavy rain.</td><td>Weather</td><td>DJB Air Charter</td></tr><tr><td>The cargo plane crashed into a brushy field, inverted, shortly after taking off in heavy snow. Radar data indicated that it was in a left turn at a ground speed of 109 knots before descending and impacting terrain. The plane was carrying checks and other goods for a banking customer. The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control and collision avoidance with terrain due to spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident were low cloud ceiling and night conditions.</td><td>Pilot Error</td><td>Castle Aviation</td></tr><tr><td>The jet airliner crashed while attempting to land in heavy rain at Congonhas airport. The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.</td><td>Weather</td><td>TAM (Brazil)</td></tr><tr><td>The medivac flight crashed in Devil's Canyon in the Lincoln National Forest, four minutes after taking off from Ruidoso.
